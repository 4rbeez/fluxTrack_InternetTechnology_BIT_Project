# fluxTrack Inventory Management System

fluxTrack is a web application for fluxed GmbH and its partners to manage product inventory centrally. The goal of the system is to reduce manual work, improve inventory transparency, and synchronize relevant stock data with the fluxed web shop. In the Internet Technology demonstrator, the focus is on partner login, product overview, product creation, stock adjustment, search/filter functions, and a simplified Shopify integration boundary. Different users of fluxed GmbH and its partners can receive different access rights based on their application role.

## Analysis
The original project idea comes from the need of fluxed GmbH to replace manual stock communication between the company and its partners. In the existing process, partners still communicate inventory changes manually, for example through Excel sheets, e-mail, or chat. This leads to delays, missing transparency, and situations where products may still appear purchasable although they are no longer in stock. The purpose of fluxTrack is therefore to provide a central inventory management system with real-time or near-real-time stock visibility and easier maintenance of product data. 

The assessment also requires that the application demonstrates at least three layers on two tiers, at least four views, at least four entities, and at least one business rule in the service layer. The fluxTrack concept matches this very well, because it already defines a web client, backend logic, database interaction, several product- and account-related use cases, and Shopify-related data exchange.

### Scenario

fluxTrack is a lightweight inventory management demonstrator for fluxed GmbH and its partners. Partners log into a private web application to view their products, create new product entries, adjust stock quantities, and search or filter their portfolio. fluxed GmbH can access a broader overview across partner portfolios. The system is designed to reduce manual communication, improve product data quality, and support later integration with Shopify for stock synchronization and order-related updates.

### User Stories
(1) As an admin, I want to view lists of products, partners, and stock updates so that I can monitor inventory data efficiently.
(2) As an admin, I want to create and edit products and partner data so that I can maintain correct business information in the system.
(3) As an admin, I want to review stock change history so that I can understand when and why inventory levels were updated.
(4) As an admin, I want to see the current stock quantity of each product so that I can identify shortages and avoid overselling.
(5) As an admin, I want the system to prevent invalid stock updates so that product quantities never become negative.
(6) As a partner, I want to log in to my account so that I can securely access my own inventory data.
(7) As a partner, I want to see a list of my assigned products so that I can track what is available in my store.
(8) As a partner, I want to update stock quantities for my products so that the system reflects current inventory levels.
(9) As a partner, I want to create a new product entry so that I can register products that are not yet in the system.

## Design
> 🚧: Keep in mind the Corporate Identity (CI); you shall decide appropriately the color schema, graphics, typography, layout, User Experience (UX), and so on.

### Wireframe
> 🚧: It is suggested to start with a wireframe. The wireframe focuses on the website structure (Sitemap planning), sketching the pages using Wireframe components (e.g., header, menu, footer) and UX. You can create a wireframe already with draw.io or similar tools. 

Starting from the home page, we can visit different pages. Available public pages are visible in the menu...

### Prototype
> 🚧: A prototype can be designed using placeholder text/figures in Budibase. You don't need to connect the front-end to back-end in the early stages of the project development.

### Domain Design
> 🚧: Provide a picture and describe your domain model; you may use Entity-Relationship Model or UML class diagram. Both can be created in Visual Paradigm - we have an academic license for it.

The `ch.fhnw.pizza.data.domain` package contains the following domain objects / entities including getters and setters:

### Business Logic 
> 🚧: Describe the business logic for **at least one business service** in detail. If available, show the expected path and HTPP method. The remaining documentation of APIs shall be made available in the swagger endpoint. The default Swagger UI page is available at /swagger-ui.html.

Based on the UC-4, there will be two offers and a standard offer. Given a location, a message is shown accordingly:

- If the location is "Basel", the message is "10% off on all large pizzas!!!"
- If the location is "Brugg", the message is "two for the price of One on all small pizzas!!!"
- Otherwise, the message is "No special offer".

**Path**: [`/api/menu/?location="Basel"`] 

**Param**: `value="location"` Admitted value: "Basel","Brugg".

**Method:** `GET`

## Implementation
> 🚧: Briefly describe your technology stack, which apps were used and for what.

### Backend Technology
> 🚧: It is suggested to clone this repository, but you are free to start from fresh with a Spring Initializr. If so, describe if there are any changes to the PizzaRP e.g., different dependencies, versions & etc... Please, also describe how your database is set up. If you want a persistent or in-memory H2 database check [link](https://github.com/FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/blob/main/pizza/src/main/resources/application.properties). If you have placeholder data to initialize at the app, you may use a variation of the method **initPlaceholderData()** available at [link](https://github.com/FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/blob/main/pizza/src/main/java/ch/fhnw/pizza/PizzaApplication.java).

This Web application is relying on [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) and the following dependencies:

- [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data)
- [Java Persistence API (JPA)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)
- [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com)

To bootstrap the application, the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) has been used.

Then, the following further dependencies have been added to the project `pom.xml`:

- DB:
```XML
<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

- SWAGGER:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
      <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
```

### Frontend Technology
> 🚧: Describe your views and what APIs is used on which view. If you don't have access to the Internet Technology class Budibase environment(https://inttech.budibase.app/), please write to Devid on MS teams.

This Web application was developed using Budibase and it is available for preview at https://inttech.budibase.app/app/pizzeria. 

## Execution
> 🚧: Please describe how to execute your app and what configurations must be changed to run it. 

**The codespace URL of this Repo is subject to change.** Therefore, the Budibase PizzaRP webapp is not going to show any data in the view, when the URL is not updated or the codespace is offline. Follow these steps to start the webservice and reconnect the webapp to the new webservice url. 

> 🚧: This is a shortened description for example purposes. A complete tutorial will be provided in a dedicated lecture.

1. Clone PizzaRP in a new repository.
2. Start your codespace (see video guide at: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9B7qc9lVc&ab_channel=GitHub))
3. Run the PizzaRP main available at PizzaApplication.java on your own codespace.
4. Set your app with a public port, see the guide at [link](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace).
5. Create an own Budibase app, you can export/import the existing Pizzeria app. Guide available at [link](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/export-and-import-apps).
6. Update the pizzeria URL in the datasource and publish your app.

### Deployment to a PaaS
> 🚧: Deployment to PaaS is optional but recommended as it will make your application (backend) accessible without server restart and through a unique, constantly available link.  

Alternatively, you can deploy your application to a free PaaS like [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/register).
1. Refer to the Dockerfile inside the application root (FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/pizza).
2. Adapt line 13 to the name of your jar file. The jar name should be derived from the details in the pom.xml as follows:<br>
`{artifactId}-{version}.jar` 
2. Login to Render using your GitHub credentials.
3. Create a new Web Service and choose Build and deploy from a Git repository.
4. Enter the link to your (public) GitHub repository and click Continue.
5. Enter the Root Directory (name of the folder where pom.xml resides).
6. Choose the Instance Type as Free/Hobby. All other details are default.
7. Click on Create Web Service. Your app will undergo automatic build and deployment. Monitor the logs to view the progress or error messages. The entire process of Build+Deploy might take several minutes.
8. After successful deployment, you can access your backend using the generated unique URL (visible on top left under the name of your web service).
9. This unique URL will remain unchanged as long as your web service is deployed on Render. You can now integrate it in Budibase to make API calls to your custom endpoints.
